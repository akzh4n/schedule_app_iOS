# Unischedule (Schedule App)

Unischedule is an application (pet project) developed by me for easy viewing of the schedule of classes of the university. 
And also there is an opportunity to view information about each teacher (work experience, role, mail), in addition, was added a system of authentication.

The project was made by me for a short time, and just my own interest, as I would like to benefit by applying and improving their knowledge, well, and of course I use myself.

Perhaps will be finalized, if the university administration will approve for further use by students.
